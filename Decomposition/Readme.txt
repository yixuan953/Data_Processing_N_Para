Soil N supply through SOM decomposition at annual scale is calculated using the following function:
Soil_N_decomp = (SOC * SOC_decomposition_rate * CorrectionFactor_temp * CorrectionFactor_moisture * GrowingDays/365) / soil CN ratio

In which:
1 - SOC data is available from the HSWD at: https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/1361509511e44adfba814f6950c6e742/
    - Variable name: oc [percent weight, 0-1]
    - Long name: Topsoil Organic Carbon 
2 - Soil decomposition rate = 0.05/yr (Reference?)
3 - CorrectionFactor_temp: m_temp. The temperature [celsuis degree] (-10, 40) --> m_temp (0, 6.5)
    m_temp = 47.91 / (1 + e^(106.6 / (T + 18.27))) 
    Here, T is the monthly mean temperature calculated basing on the daily mean temperature.
4 - CorrectionFactor_moisture: 
5 - GrowingDays: The data source is from the crop calendar of Sacks et al. (2010) (DOI: 10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00551.x)
Here:
    For regions where maturity and sowing happen in the same year: GrowingDays =  (mat_a1 - sow_a1)  (average matuarity date - average sowing date) * 10 (in order to transform dekad to days) 
    For regions where maturity and sowing happen in different years: GrowingDays =  (36 - sow_a1 + mat_a1) * 10
6 - Soil CN ratio is available from SoilGrids at: https://files.isric.org/soilgrids/latest/.
Here:
    6-1 Soil organic carbon (dg/kg) is available for 3 layers (0-5, 5-15, 15-30 cm) at 5 km 
    6-2 Soil bulk density (cg/cm3) is available for 3 layers (0-5, 5-15, 15-30 cm) at 5 km
    6-3 Soil nitrogen content (cg/kg) is available for 3 layers (0-5, 5-15, 15-30 cm) at 5 km
The data is upscaled to 0-30 cm at 0.5 degree, by aggregating the total SOC and soil N amount [kg] (SOC_content or Soil_N_content * BulkDensity * LayerDepth * 5km * 5km)
