This file describes the parameters that used for calculating the N-cycling process

To calculate the following factors, we need the original inputs as follows:

1.  Climate:
1-1 Annual precipitation [mm]
1-2 Monthly precipitation [mm]
1-3 Monthly average temperature [celsuis degree]

2.  Hydrology (will be integrated with wofost except the evapotranspiration to classify the climate zone):
2-1 Monthly evapotranspiration [mm]: Available from ERA5 at https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/multi-origin-c3s-atlas?tab=download

3.  Soil:
3-1 Clay content of soil [percent weight, hwsd]
3-2 Soil texture [sand, loam, peat, clay, & heavy clay, hwsd]
    Reference for texture_class coding number: https://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~sujan/research/gswp3/soil-texture-map.html 
3-3 Initial SOC [percent weight, hwsd]
3-4 C:N ratio from ISRIC: https://files.isric.org/soilgrids/latest/

4.  Others
4-1 Slope [-]: https://data.isimip.org/datasets/20c14b44-45f6-48c4-b9e7-0039e71ba134/

---------------------- Emission Factors -------------------
The gaseous emission contains three parts: NH3, N2O, and NOx
1. NH3 emission factor[-] depends on fertilizer types:
   1) Urea-based inorganic fertilizers = 0.15
   2) Manure = 0.20
   3) Other fertilizers = 0.02
2. N2O emission factor[-]: Depends on fertilizer types (residue, manure, inorganic) and climate zone
3. NOx emission factor[-]: Depends on annual precipitation

----------- N losses through leaching and runoff ----------
1. Runoff fraction = Lmax_runoff * min(fpre, ftexture, frock)
2. Leaching fraction = Lmax_leaching * min(flanduse, fpre, ftemp, froot, fsoc)

----------------------- N decomposition -----------------
1. N supply from SOM decomposition [day-1]
   = C total (Roth CN soil C pool) * k_rate (decompostion rate = 0.05 per year) * Modification(temp, moisture) / 365
   In which:
   - m_temp = 47.91/(1+e^106.06/(T+18.27))
   - m_moist ~ TSMD (depends on monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration)
   - k_rate is a constant that could be changed according to the environmental conditions of our study areas

------------------------- Other Factors --------------------
1. N fixation: 
   - Arable crops: 2 kg N ha-1 yr-1  
   - Legumes: 80% of the total N demand
2. Humification coefficient (hc, unit: -): 
   (1-hc) = how much organic input (manure + residue) will be available for crop uptake in inorganic format
