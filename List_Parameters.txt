This file describes the parameters that used for calculating the N-cycling process

To calculate the following factors, we need the original inputs as follows:

1.  Climate:
1-1 Annual precipitation [mm]
1-2 Monthly precipitation [mm]
1-3 Monthly average temperature [celsuis degree]

2.  Hydrology:
2-1 Monthly evapotranspiration? 
2-2 Fraction of groundwater leaching [we use the results of WOFOST or VIC? potential yield, rainfed, irrigated?]
2-3 

3.  Soil:
3-1 Clay content of soil [percent weight, hwsd]
3-2 Soil texture [sand, loam, peat, clay, & heavy clay, hwsd]
    Reference for texture_class coding number: https://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~sujan/research/gswp3/soil-texture-map.html 
3-3 Initial SOC [percent weight, hwsd]
3-4 C:N ratio from ISRIC: https://files.isric.org/soilgrids/latest/
3-5 Obstacle to roots [20-40 cm, 40-60 cm, 60-80 cm, no obstacle]: Only Europe has this data, can we use clay content?

4.  Others
4-1 Slope [-]: https://data.isimip.org/datasets/20c14b44-45f6-48c4-b9e7-0039e71ba134/
4-2 

---------------------- Emission Factors -------------------
The gaseous emission contains three parts: NH3, N2O, and NOx
1. NH3 emission factor[-]of: (country-specific?)
   1) Urea-based inorganic fertilizers
   2) Other inorganic fertilizers + manure
2. N2O emission factor[-]: 
3. NOx emission factor[-]: Depends on annual precipitation


----------- N losses through leaching and runoff ----------
1. Runoff fraction = Lmax_runoff * fpre * ftexture * frock
2. Leaching fraction = Lmax_leaching * flanduse * fpre * ftemp * froot * fsoc
3. Ground flow fraction ????

----------------------- N supply from soil -----------------
1. Mineralization rate []: From humus to inorganic N that is available for crop uptakes
2. N supply from SOM decomposition [month-1]
   = C total (Roth CN soil C pool) * k_rate (decompostion rate = 0.05 per year) * Modification(temp, moisture) * growing days/365
   In which:
   - m_temp = 47.91/(1+e^106.06/(T+18.27))
   - m_moist ~ TSMD (depends on monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration [which one should I use? No water limitation, with irrigation, or fully coupled evapotranspiration])

------------------------- Other Factors --------------------
1. N fixation: 
   Arable crops: 2 kg N ha-1 yr-1  
   Legumes: Fixated N is assumed to be equal to the amount of N in harvested products (????)
